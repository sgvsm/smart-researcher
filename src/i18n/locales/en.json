    "questions": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "Is this just another literature review tool?",
        "answer": "No. This is a complete research platform that goes far beyond simple literature search. It reads and analyzes papers, synthesizes findings, conducts systematic coding of qualitative data, and maintains rigorous evidence trails - all with AI assistance but under your control."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "How can I trust AI-generated research?",
        "answer": "You shouldn't blindly trust any tool - ours included. That's why we provide complete transparency: every claim links to source papers, every analysis shows its evidence trail, and you can verify any finding. The AI is a research assistant, not a replacement for your expertise."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "What fields does this work for?",
        "answer": "Any field with published research: social sciences, health sciences, education, business, policy, humanities, and more. Our AI understands academic writing across disciplines and adapts to your specific methodology."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "How much does it cost?",
        "answer": "A comprehensive systematic review (searching, reading, and analyzing 10,000+ papers) costs approximately $500-800 in total. Compare this to months of research assistant time or commercial review services charging $10,000+. We believe powerful research tools should be accessible to all researchers."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Can I use this for my dissertation/publication?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Our platform is designed for rigorous academic work. The systematic approach, complete documentation, and transparency make it ideal for dissertations, grant applications, and peer-reviewed publications. Many researchers are already citing AI-assisted systematic reviews in top journals."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "Do you replace human researchers?",
        "answer": "No. We amplify human researchers. You define the research questions, set the criteria, interpret the findings, and draw the conclusions. The AI handles the time-consuming systematic work: searching, reading, categorizing, and maintaining consistency. You focus on insight and discovery."
